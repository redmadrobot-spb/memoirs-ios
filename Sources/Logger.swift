    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - level: Logging level.
    ///   - label: Specifies in what part log event was recorded.
    ///   - message: Message describing log event.
    ///   - meta: Additional log information in key-value format.
    ///   - file: The path to the file from which the method was called. Usually you should use the #file literal for this.
    ///   - function: The function name from which the method was called. Usually you should use the #function literal for this.
    ///   - line: The line of code from which the method was called. Usually you should use the #line literal for this.
